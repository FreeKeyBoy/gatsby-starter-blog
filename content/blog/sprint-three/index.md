## Individual Accomplishments

Sadly I wasn’t able to accomplish much on this sprint. The goal was to have the functionality complete to allow the user to upload a couples photo to their personal website, save their names, wedding dates, and personal story to the database, and time permitting, use conditional components to render their selections as their own personal page within the app. None of that happened. What I did was, make the three design pages responsive to different size screens. So it wasn’t a total waste of time, I suppose. 

## Detailed Analysis

There really isn’t much to analyze here. Responsive design using styled components isn’t very complicated. I also used a flexbox layout with percentages for margins and widths, so there wasn’t much to do. I approached the layout with responsiveness in mind. 

I spent much of the last two weeks trying to get the photo upload working. I thought I had a simple set up going when I started, but I had zero knowledge of how the back end was set up. The server was easy enough to plug in, but I just couldn’t get the image to render on the page, after it was loaded to the cloud server. Now that the AWS is running, I’ll end up ditching the last to weeks worth of work, and adding in a get by ID route to accomplish the goal, using the AWS services, and not the cloud server I was planning on using. As for the user data I want to save to the database, that will also be a simple matter of axios routes, so saved that for last.

## Weekly Reflection

The real challenge I faced on this sprint was finding the support I needed to accomplish my goals. I knew I needed to work with dev A because his goal was similar to mine, therefore if we worked together, we’d be able to reach our project goals at the same time. But me and dev A seem to have communication issues. So instead, I chose to go my own route and work with dev B who was also familiar with the backend well enough to help me get my part of the project launched. It almost worked. Instead, I wound up biting myself in the backside. Perhaps it was hubris, perhaps it was fear of confrontation, but I gambled and lost. Now I have to put in extra hours to catch up to where I thought I would be at this stage. I’ll chalk this up to being a learning experience, since there’s no point in dwelling on past mistakes. Instead I’ll own it, and do what I should have done in the first place, work with dev A, who’s flex day is tomorrow evening. Hopefully, we can catch up quickly. 

Part of the problem was I continually let myself get brushed off. One dev needed help with stripe, so I stood back and let that take priority. Another dev needed help with heroku. So I let that take priority. Then someone needed help with AWS. That should be a priority. By the time everything was done, there was no time left for my goals. Perhaps I should have been more assertive in making sure, I had the support I needed to keep on schedule. Perhaps it won’t be a big deal in the long run, and I’m over thinking the problem. Time will tell. But one thing I know, is that I will be more vocal in the upcoming sprints as far as what I need and who I need it from. I am a major contributor to this project after all. If I fall behind, we all suffer. Tonight, I’ll rest, and recharge my mental batteries. Tomorrow, I’ll approach the project renewed.
