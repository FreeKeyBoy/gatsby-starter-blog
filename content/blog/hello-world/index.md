##Individual Accomplishments

I'm pretty happy with my accomplishments over the last two weeks. Not thrilled but happy. It would seem that my pet project for the lab is the three design templates for the consumer to choose from, for their personal website. Since I have training as a graphic designer, it makes sense to give me this assignment. It will be good practice too, since this will involve UI work, and database management. By the time this is done, I’ll have had my hands in a little bit of everything in this assignment. 

##Detailed Analysis

Most of my time on this sprint has been spent on the functionality of these pages. Specifically getting the text areas of these pages to grow dynamically as the user fills in the input. Scroll bars would look ugly in this instance, and getting this accomplished natively, looked complicated. Thankfully, there’s a plug-in for that. React-textarea-autosize. If you’re ever in this situation, I highly recommend this plug-in. It’s easy to use, and once installed, I had it up and running in a matter of minutes. 

Next was making it so that the user will be able to upload a photo to their website. No shortcut for this one, but it was easy enough to find a working example of this function, that I was able to adapt to this project easily enough. I felt a nice rush of satisfaction the first time I tested it, and the root directory on my computer opened exactly as planned. 

Both of these features need styling. That’s a given. But styling is something to worry about at a later date. I have to keep reminding myself of this, thanks to my artistic background. I have this ingrained compulsion to make everything look pretty before I’m comfortable moving on. 

That being said, it is far more imperative that I get these two features working on the back end. It won’t do any good if the user's input is lost when the site refreshes. So for this I’m pair programing with one of the backend devs tomorrow. I haven’t spent much time familiarizing myself with how the backend team set everything up. I would feel more comfortable if one of them gave me a tour of the backend before I go around messing with the tables and server. Thankfully, my backend needs are simple and should be easy to integrate. I hope to have the features deployed by the end of the weekend. If I fall a little short of that goal, well, we’re slightly ahead of the curve, so deploying on monday would be no great setback. 

##Weekly Reflection

Looking back on the last couple weeks, I'm starting to realize that working in a dev based group, is a bit different than the other group environments that I’ve worked in before. In some aspects it’s easier. We all have quite a bit in common. There is a certain personality type that usually gets into this field. But this also brings challenges of its own. In the Army, it’s helpful to be blunt, and rude if necessary, in order to get your point across. Sure there would be some friction, but it passes quickly. We were trained to work under stress and conflict, and overcome it in order to complete the mission. 

Tech is a professional setting. Sure, many of the people I’m working with aren’t offended by potty mouth language, but it is something to be avoided. Also, I have to put on my diplomatic hat more often than not. Now this isn’t an issue for me. I pride myself on being able to get along with almost everyone. Almost. I got a sharp wit, and my ego isn’t so over inflated, that I can’t recognize a good idea when someone else says it, and praise others for their contributions. 

But I am also used to a rigid chain of command, clear objectives, and pre planned protocols to accomplish those objectives. These are not things, that exist in this project, and I doubt I’ll see them often in the professional dev world either. This has caused some friction, and I expect it to continue to do so, as the deadlines continue to approach. Not everyone is trained to operate under stress. Even I lose my temper and start snapping every now and then. Especially when I perceive others as not following instruction, or making my work harder than it needs to be.  

Luckily, even having been a soldier, I’ve always considered words to be my best weapon. When someone isn’t being heard, my bluntness can cut through the chatter, to correct the problem. All I have to do is wait for the person monopolizing the conversation to take a breath, and quickly interject a question. “Hey, soandso, what were you saying a moment ago? Sounded interesting.” It also works in decision making. If someone is going off on a tangent, “Sounds great, but that’s a week five thing. Maybe we should table this for now, and come back to it after we got ____ worked out.” That gives them time to think about their idea, and either decide it was too ambitious, or come up with a way to easily, and quickly deploy it. 

It may sound odd, but my goal is to become a project manager. My leadership experience, combined with my natural ability to read people, with my goal driven mindset, I think it will be a good position for me, once I have the experience to fulfil the duties of the job.
